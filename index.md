## About Me
I'm creating projects using Java and C++ and interested in GUI applications. I am studying at Istanbul Technical University.

### H Component Library
Java swing is easy to use tool to create GUIs, Java swing comes with standard development kit. However in C++ there is no Java swing like library to create GUI applications. There are many object oriented libraries for C++, but their syntax is not as easy as Java swing for a C++ beginner who came from Java. Therefore we created a Java swing like library for C++.<br/>

H Componen Library(HCl) is a free to use lightweight Java like Windows GUI library for C++.<br/>
You can use Java Swing on your C++ projects.<br/>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yusufhanoglu/yusufhanoglu.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
