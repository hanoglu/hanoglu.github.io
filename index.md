### H Component Library (HCl)
Java swing is easy to use tool to create GUIs, Java swing comes with standard development kit. However in C++ there is no Java swing like library to create GUI applications. There are many object oriented libraries for C++, but their syntax is not as easy as Java swing for a C++ beginner who came from Java. Therefore we created a Java swing like library for C++.<br/>
